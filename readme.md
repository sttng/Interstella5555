# Intro

When "One More Time" was released in late 2000 and I first saw the music video on MTV (at that time MTV was still showing music videos), I was blown away.
One of my favourite bands (Daft Punk) created a Japanese Anime music video matching the style of one of my favourite TV shows as a kid - Queen Millennia (新竹取物語・1000年女王).
I couldn't wait for the collaboration to finish and when Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (インターステラ5555) was finally released in 2003, 
one of the first things I did was buying a ticket to see in on the big screen in my local movie theater.
As this was many, many years ago, I actually can't remember the quality of the movie in the theater - meaning I actually don't really know if it was a blown-up version with a soft, pixelated look or not.
