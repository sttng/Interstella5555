# Intro

When **One More Time** was released in late 2000 and I first saw the music video on MTV (at that time MTV was still showing music videos), I was blown away. One of my favourite bands (**Daft Punk**) created a Japanese animation-style music video, matching the visuals of one of my favourite TV shows as a kid - **Queen Millennia (新竹取物語・1000年女王)**. I couldn't wait for the collaboration to finish and when **Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (インターステラ5555)** was finally released in 2003, one of the first things I did was buying a ticket to watch it on the big screen in my local movie theater.

When the DVD was released in end 2003 in Europe, of course it was an instant buy for me. However, when I put the DVD into my Pioneer Drive in my computer, I couldn't believe what I saw: Interlacing all over the place ! No progressive mode to be found anywhere - clearly the European customers must have been ripped off. 

So my search began and several months later a shipment from Amazon Japan arrived - with the Japanese DVD Special Edition. Super excited I started to watch, what I thought had to be a good version of that movie (clearly the Japanese special edition could only be better then the euro version - or so I thought). Only again, this was a badly mastered, interlaced version. Again a disappointment.

Years later, just by accident I saw the Interstella 5555 Blu-ray (BD), in my local record store at discount, and grabbed this version. My hopes where not high this time, and even then, whoever produced this was able to disappoint me again. The PAL BD version looked like an upscale of the PAL DVD version - unbelievable.

As I saw the movie in the theater many, many years ago, I actually can't remember the quality of the movie in the theater - meaning I actually don't really know if it was a blown-up version with a soft, pixelated look or not - but surely I remember that I didn't feel the movie theater version looked bad in any way. Nevertheless I also think I have read or heared somewhere (sorry no source), that Interstella 5555 was actually only produced in a SD format. If my memory serves me correct, Toei Animation was already using digital animation tools at that time and only the drawing sketches where produced whith real pen and paper, while the animations where drawn in SD resolution.

So below find a comparison of the disks I own, and also a verdict for which is the best (of the worst).

# Findings

- Based on the interlacing comparison the PAL BD seems to be an upscale from the PAL DVD or of a pan-and-scan 4:3 PAL master with simple frame blending as "deinterlacing".
- The PAL BD is cropped at the top and bottom compared to the PAL DVD.
- The NTSC (J) DVD is cropped at the top and bottom compared to the PAL DVD.
- The NTSC (J) DVD seems to be produced using a 3:2 pull down Telecine conversion from 24 frames/s to ~29.97 frame/s.
- No version is using progessive frames unfortunately.
- The PAL DVD version seems to be the "best" version as it retains the most image information - due to having no or the smallest cropping and also having approx 20% (or 96 additional lines) higher vertical resolution then the NTSC (J) DVD.
- The PAL DVD has a slightly higher *Bits/(Pixel x Frame)* valuec compared to the NTSC (J) DVD, meaning that it has less compression and in theory a picture more true to the original. In reality however the difference is so small and neglectable that it would be impossible to spot a difference.
- The PAL BD seems to have a slightly brighter and warmer color grading compared to both DVD versions.

## Cropping Examples
![Cropping Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sttng/Interstella5555/main/Cropping_Examples.jpg "Cropping Comparison")

The PAL BD has the most cropping, the NTSC (J) DVD has minor cropping, the PAL DVD has the least or no cropping and sometimes has 3-4 pixels of black bars at the top and bottom, which indicates the full movie frame was scanned with slight savety margin (no cropping).

# Comparison Examples

Screenshots were created using [VirtualDub2](http://virtualdub2.com/). The settings below were used to get examples from the source data streams, without introducing scaling or deinterlacing post-processing from the player software. A 1:1 pixel aspect ratio means that the screenshots of the PAL and NTSC DVDs are shown as they are stored but not shown as they are should:
- Zoom 100%
- 1:1 pixel (Square)
- copy-pasted to Paint.Net and saved as 24bit PNG
