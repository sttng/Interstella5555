# Intro

When "One More Time" was released in late 2000 and I first saw the music video on MTV (at that time MTV was still showing music videos), I was blown away.
One of my favourite bands (Daft Punk) created a Japanese Anime music video matching the style of one of my favourite TV shows as a kid - Queen Millennia (新竹取物語・1000年女王).
I couldn't wait for the collaboration to finish and when Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (インターステラ5555) was finally released in 2003, 
one of the first things I did was buying a ticket to see in on the big screen in my local movie theater.

As this was many, many years ago, I actually can't remember the quality of the movie in the theater - meaning I actually don't really know if it was a blown-up version with a soft, pixelated look or not.

# Findings

- Based on the interlacing comparison the PAL BD seems to be an upscale from the PAL DVD or of a pan-and-scan 4:3 PAL master with simple frame blending as "deinterlacing".
- The PAL BD is cropped at the top and bottom compared to the PAL DVD.
- The NTSC (J) DVD is cropped at the top and bottom compared to the PAL DVD.
- The NTSC (J) DVD seems to be produced using a 3:2 pull down Telecine conversion from 24 frames/s to ~29.97 frame/s.
- No version is using progessive frames unfortunately.
- The PAL (DVD) version seems to be the "best" version as it retains the most image information - due to having no or the smallest cropping and also having approx 20% (or 96 additional lines) higher vertical resolution then the NTSC (J) DVD.
